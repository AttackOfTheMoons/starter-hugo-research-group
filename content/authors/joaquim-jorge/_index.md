Joaquim Jorge is Full Professor of Computer Graphics and Multimedia at the Departamento de Engenharia Informática do Instituto Superior Técnico da Universidade de Lisboa in Lisbon, Portugal [http://web.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/jorgej](http://web.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/jorgej), and Scientific Coordinator of the Research Group on Visualization and Multimodal Interfaces of the Institute for Computer and Systems Engineering INESC-ID.  He was Visiting Assistant Professor at the Technical University of Darmstadt in 1999 and has been Adjunct Professor with the Computer Science Department of the University of Calgary since 2006. He was a Visiting Professor at the Tech. Univ. of Vienna in 2012.

He received a Bach. Science in Electrical Engineering (Major in Telecommunications), from Instituto Superior Técnico (IST), Lisboa 1984 and MSc (1992) and PhD (1994) degrees in Computer Science from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY. He received his Habilitation in Computer Graphics from IST, Technical University of Lisbon in 2002.

A pioneer of Computer Graphics, he first joined Eurographics (EG) in 1986 and ACM/SIGGRAPH in 1989. He was a member of the EG Publications Board from 1997 to 2000 and was elected member of the EG Executive Committee from 2000 to 2006. Dr. Jorge is the ACM/SIGGRAPH Small Conferences Committee Chair since 2014. He was ACM/SIGRAPH Education Committee Member from 2002 to 2011. He received the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) Silver Core Award for services to Technical Committee 13 (Human-Computer Interaction) in 2014, Best Paper Award at VS-Games Conference (2013), Ivan Petrovic Best Paper Award in Computer Aided Architectural Design in Europe (eCAADE), 2012 and the Best Paper Award of IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications in 2012. Since 2007, he is Editor-in-Chief of the Computers & Graphics Journal (Elsevier). He served on other journals including ERCIM News, Computer Graphics Forum 2001-2007, International Journal of Virtual Reality 2007-2011, Journal of WSCG since 2007 and serves on the Committee on Publication Ethics since 2009. He was elected to the ACM Europe Council in 2015.

He was Proposal Evaluator of NSF ITR Program from 2001 to 2003.
