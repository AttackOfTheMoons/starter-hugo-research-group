The **Interactive Realities Laboratory** (IRLAB) at the University of North Carolina - Greensboro is discovering how to improve virtual and augmented realities, to create the final extended reality experience.

The laboratory is directed by Dr. Regis Kopper in several research projects to boost the usability of extended reality.

This lab works to improve many fields such as public safety, health care, neuroscience, and the humanities.

Using new tangible devices, the lab strives to implement an extended reality experience without the drawbacks that presently exist.
