[Conference Paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/360089920_Studying_the_Effect_of_Physical_Realism_on_Time_Perception_in_a_HAZMAT_VR_Simulation)

Research has found a time compression effect related to virtual reality. Just like how we feel like time passes quicker when we are on the computer, time feels quicker in VR. Our motivation is to reduce this effect to achieve VR experiences that are closer to real life. We are researching to what degree passive haptics affect our perception of time. We created an immersive VR experience where the virtual environment simulates the actual room around the user, moving objects such as doors, some devices, and users' hands are tracked and displayed through the VR headset as well.
