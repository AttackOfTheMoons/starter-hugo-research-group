<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The interaction between police officers and drivers is a critical factor that can endanger the officer and requires extensive training. A Virtual Reality (VR) solution can help with training, expose officers to controlled risks, and improve their performance. This is possible because VR features can influence interpersonal interactions and how real the experience is perceived. Therefore, we propose a project to develop and validate a VR tool to simulate traffic stops with a focus on measurable training outcomes. Furthermore, we intend to design and implement a trainer user interface for personalizing the traffic stop simulation and to assess the benefit of next-generation traffic stop technology over current traffic stop technology.</p>
