abstract: An important issue of psychological research is how experiments conducted
  in the laboratory or theories based on such experiments relate to human performance
  in daily life. Immersive virtual reality (VR) allows control over stimuli and conditions
  at increased ecological validity. The goal of the present study was to accomplish
  a transfer of traditional paradigms that assess attention and distraction to immersive
  VR. To further increase ecological validity we explored attentional effects with
  daily objects as stimuli instead of simple letters. Participants searched for a
  target among distractors on the countertop of a virtual kitchen. Target–distractor
  discriminability was varied and the displays were accompanied by a peripheral flanker
  that was congruent or incongruent to the target. Reaction time was slower when target–distractor
  discriminability was low and when flankers were incongruent. The results were replicated
  in a second experiment in which stimuli were presented on a computer screen in two
  dimensions. The study demonstrates the successful translation of traditional paradigms
  and manipulations into immersive VR and lays a foundation for future research on
  attention and distraction in VR. Further, we provide an outline for future studies
  that should use features of VR that are not available in traditional laboratory
  research.
