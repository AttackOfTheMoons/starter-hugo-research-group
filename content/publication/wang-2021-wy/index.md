abstract: Selection by progressive refinement allows the accurate acquisition of targets
  with small visual sizes while keeping the required precision of the task low. Using
  the eyes as a means to perform 3D selections is naturally hindered by the low accuracy
  of eye movements. To account for this low accuracy, we propose to use the concept
  of progressive refinement to allow accurate 3D selection. We designed a novel eye
  tracking selection technique with progressive refinement--Eye-controlled Sphere-casting
  refined by QUAD-menu (EyeSQUAD). We propose an approximation method to stabilize
  the calculated point-of-regard and a space partitioning method to improve computation.
  We evaluated the performance of EyeSQUAD in comparison to two previous selection
  techniques--ray-casting and SQUAD--under different target size and distractor density
  conditions. Results show that EyeSQUAD outperforms previous eye tracking-based selection
  techniques, is more accurate and can achieve similar selection speed as ray-casting,
  and is less accurate and slower than SQUAD. We discuss implications of designing
  eye tracking-based progressive refinement interaction techniques and provide a potential
  solution for multimodal user interfaces with eye tracking.
