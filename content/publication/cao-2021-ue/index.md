abstract: Dynamic field of view (FOV) restrictors have been successfully used to reduce
  visually induced motion sickness (VIMS) during continuous viewpoint motion control
  (virtual travel) in virtual reality (VR). This benefit, however, comes at the cost
  of losing peripheral awareness during provocative motion. Likewise, the use of visual
  references that are stable in relation to the physical environment, called rest
  frames (RFs), has also been shown to reduce discomfort during virtual travel tasks
  in VR. We propose a new RF-based design called Granulated Rest Frames (GRFs) with
  a soft-edged circular cutout in the center that leverages the rest frames' benefits
  without completely blocking the user's peripheral view. The GRF design is application-agnostic
  and does not rely on context-specific RFs, such as commonly used cockpits. We report
  on a within-subjects experiment with 20 participants. The results suggest that,
  by strategically applying GRFs during a visual search session in VR, we can achieve
  better item searching efficiency as compared to restricted FOV. The effect of GRFs
  on reducing VIMS remains to be determined by future work.
