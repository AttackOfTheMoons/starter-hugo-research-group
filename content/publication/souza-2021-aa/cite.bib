 abstract = {The effectiveness of a virtual reality experience is strongly affected by the sense
of presence of the users involved. This article reviews the different definitions
of presence and the main proposed methods to measure it through the analysis of 1,214
papers published in the past 30 years. From the analysis of 239 user studies, we found
that 85.8% used subjective measures, 11.7% used a combination of subjective and objective
measures, while 2.5% used only objective measures. We also identified, from the studies
reviewed, 29 main factors to evoke presence in virtual environments, grouped into
four categories: Engagement, Personal Characteristics, Interaction Fidelity, and Display
Fidelity.},
