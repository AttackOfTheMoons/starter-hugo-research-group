abstract: 'The effectiveness of a virtual reality experience is strongly affected
  by the sense of presence of the users involved. This article reviews the different
  definitions of presence and the main proposed methods to measure it through the
  analysis of 1,214 papers published in the past 30 years. From the analysis of 239
  user studies, we found that 85.8% used subjective measures, 11.7% used a combination
  of subjective and objective measures, while 2.5% used only objective measures. We
  also identified, from the studies reviewed, 29 main factors to evoke presence in
  virtual environments, grouped into four categories: Engagement, Personal Characteristics,
  Interaction Fidelity, and Display Fidelity.'
