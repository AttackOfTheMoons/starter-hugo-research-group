abstract: Sensorimotor learning refers to improvements that occur through practice
  in the performance of sensory-guided motor behaviors. Leveraging novel technical
  capabilities of an immersive virtual environment, we probed the component kinematic
  processes that mediate sensorimotor learning. Twenty naı̈ve subjects performed a
  simulated marksmanship task modeled after Olympic Trap Shooting standards. We measured
  movement kinematics and shooting performance as participants practiced 350 trials
  while receiving trial-by-trial feedback about shooting success. Spatiotemporal analysis
  of motion tracking elucidated the ballistic and refinement phases of hand movements.
  We found systematic changes in movement kinematics that accompanied improvements
  in shot accuracy during training, though reaction and response times did not change
  over blocks. In particular, we observed longer, slower, and more precise ballistic
  movements that replaced effort spent on corrections and refinement. Collectively,
  these results leverage developments in immersive virtual reality technology to quantify
  and compare the kinematics of movement during early learning of full-body sensorimotor
  orienting.
